Hello, my name is Cole
This will be a site that I use to house my poems



What others add
to the epochal song, 
I adopt and give my voice,
my life. I play the music
that others sing and others write.
But in my heart
a rhythm all its own does play
—the inner song
only I can feel,
whose words create
a life their own, 
which I learn to live and demonstrate.

The inner verse
is meaning’s light, the gold
and diamond 
rivered clean—
it is the sight that burns like flame
without wood or kerosene.
The inner verse
turns like the world,
which grows like fruit,
and forms as clay—
the inner verse,
burning bright,
knowledge that moves the universe
and gives the sun
its right of day.
